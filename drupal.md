# Drupal

## What is it?

Drupal is one of the major content management systems in PHP. It has a huge community and ecosphere around it, including contributors, companies and non-profits. There are many Drupal-themed events worldwide as well.

## How to support

Supporting Drupal can be done through the Drupal Association, a non-profit organization that does a lot of work for the Drupal project. [Donate here](https://assoc.drupal.org/donate).
