# Open Source Initiative

## What is it?

As stated on their website:

  > We are the stewards of the Open Source Definition (OSD) and the community-recognized body for reviewing and approving licenses as OSD-conformant.

## How to support

The Open Source Initiative [takes donations](https://opensource.org/donate) in several ways, including Flattr. You can also [join as a member](https://opensource.org/join). For people who pay taxes in the US, it is of interest that OSI is a 501(c)(3) deductible organization.

## Why support?

The OSI supports open source in so many different ways that it's hard to summarize: They educate, promote and support open source and open source projects.
