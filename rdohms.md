# Rafael Dohms

## What is it?

Open Source and Community addict, Rafael Dohms has a bunch of projects around and tries to actively contribute to other OSS projects out there. From [pronto!](http://rdohms.github.io/pronto) to [Podtrack](http://podtrack.me) and every other PHP project out there that can use some help.

## How to support

I setup a [patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/rdohms), as a trial, to collect funds and allow contributors to mess around with my priority list. Just signup for your contribution and let me know what you want me to work on.

## Why support?

This is a new setup for PHP, Patreon is widely used for arts and other areas, but I want to explore its use within the OSS community. Making it easier for companies and developers to connect and support each other. Hopefully we can make this a place you can sponsor PHP related OSS work, like specific features or libraries.
