# Neos

## What is it?

Neos is an open source "Content Application Platform". A set of core Content Management features is resting within a larger context that allows you to build a perfectly customized experience for your users.

## How to support

The project itself is not a formal entity that can accept donations, but the Neos community has [found a partner for this](https://www.neos.io/news/neos-project-funding-platform.html). The Sandstorm company will accept donations from individuals and companies by [selling badges](https://neosfunding.sandstorm.de/en). Aside from the standard badges, there are custom badges available on request.
