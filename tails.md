# Tails - the amnesic incognito live system

## What is it?

Tails is a live operating system, that you can start on almost any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card. It aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity, and helps you to:

- use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship;
- all connections to the Internet are forced to go through the Tor network;
- leave no trace on the computer you are using unless you ask it explicitly;
- use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, emails and instant messaging.

## How to support

The tails website has a [special donation page](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/donate/index.en.html) listing the donation options.

## Why support?

Tails is named as one of the [7 essential tools for making the Edward Snowden Documentary](https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2014/10/7-privacy-tools-essential-making-citizenfour) by EFF.
If you are into privacy and want to contribute to a good way of using the TOR network it's definitively a good way to donate money.
