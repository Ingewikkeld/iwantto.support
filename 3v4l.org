# 3v4l.org

## What is it?

3v4l.org has turned in a short time into the most used website for trying and sharing PHP code snippets. One of the major 
features is these snippets will run on not one, but 150(!)PHP versions so you can easily test (regression) bugs. Besides this, 
it has all kind of nifty features like displaying VLD opcode and performance timings.

## How to support

To keep this site running it will need about ~100 mBTC monthly. You can donate through [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/3v4l.org/) or [Bitcoin](bitcoin://3DJhjy98RiQRc7751B4PPugMkG3BGVogrX?amount=0.01&label=3v4l.org).
