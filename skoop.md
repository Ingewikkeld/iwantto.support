# Stefan Koopmanschap

## What is it?

I have little actual code contributions to open source (aside from small pull requests with bug fixes and documentation), but I have been involved with open source projects since the 90's. My contributions include support, blogging, documentation, translation, community management and overall advocacy. I also speak at conferences on a regular basis.

## How to support

There is a [patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/skoop) where you can donate money per "blogpost". There is also a Paypal.me-link on the [about page of leftontheweb.com](http://leftontheweb.com/about/).

## Why support?

We should be more supportive of both open source projects and their individual developers. I am not looking at making a lot of money this way, but it would be very nice to get some beer (or in my case whisky) money every once in a while in return for what I do and have done.
