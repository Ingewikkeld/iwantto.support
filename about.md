# About I Want To Support

On June 3rd, Joshua Thijssen posted a [blogpost about elePHPants](https://www.adayinthelifeof.nl/2015/06/03/the-php-elephant-stampede/) and how we spend a lot of money on those little furry plush animals, yet we don't support open source authors often enough. While we at [Ingewikkeld](http://php.ingewikkeld.net/) love our elePHPants, he has a point about us perhaps not supporting open source authors enough.

This prompted us to take ~~[Sculpin](https://sculpin.io/)~~ [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), open a [Github repository](https://github.com/Ingewikkeld/iwantto.support) and start this site. The purpose of this site is to give everyone who has a few bucks to spare to be able to find a good project to support.

## Contributing

Keep in mind that contributing to open source is not just about giving money. You can also donate time and effort, documentation, testing, hosting, or anything else that a project needs to an open source project. Contact your favourite project maintainer to find out what that project needs.
