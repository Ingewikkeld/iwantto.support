# Apache Software Foundation

## What is it?

The Apache Software Foundation acts as an umbrella foundation for a large
number of open source projects, providing infrastructure, legal protection, and
further support. Some of its most popular projects include the Apache HTTP
server, CouchDB (a document-oriented NoSQL database), and subversion (a version
control system).

## How to support

The ASF maintains a dedicated
[**donation page**](http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html),
explaining in detail how to donate and how your donations will be used.
Donation options include PayPal, Amazon Payments, Bitcoin or even your old car.
The Apache Software Foundation is a registered non-profit, charitable
organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the US Internal Revenue Code, so
donations should be tax-deductible for residents of the United States.
